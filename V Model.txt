V-MODEL:-
=========
The v-model means validation and verification.
The v model life cycle is a sequential path of execution process.

VERIFICATION:-
=============
1-Verification checks whether we are building righ product or not
(To check whether the specific requirement will meet or not)

Testing the project related document is called static testing technique.
Verification does not involve code execution
Static testing technique involves-Review,Walkthrough,Inspection


VALIDATION:-
============
Validation checks whether we are building the product right or not.
Validation involves the actual testing.
Validation takes place after verification is done.
Dynamic testing technique involves-Unit testing,Integration testing,System testing,UAT

Advantage:-
=========
1-Simple,easy to understand and use.
2-Highly desciplined model and phases are completed one at a time.
3-Works well for small project where requirements are very well understand.
4-Easy to manage due to rigidity of the model.
5-Each phase has a specific deliverables and a review process.

Disadvantage:-
===========
1-Not suitable for complex and object oriented project.
2-Poor model for complex and ongoing project.
3-Not suitable for the project where requirements are at a moderate to high risk of changing.
