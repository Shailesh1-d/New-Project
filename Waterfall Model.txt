WATERFALL MODEL-:
=================
1-Waterfall model is one of the earliest software development model.
2-In which the development process looks like the flow,moving step by step through the phases like     Analysis,Design,Coding,Testing,Deployment,Maintainance
3-It is also known as Linear Sequential Model.
4-In this model each phase must be complete before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in this phase.

When to use:
=========
-Requirements are very well mannered,clear and fixed.
-Short project
-Project Scope
-Expert resources are available as per need

Advantage:
========
-Simple,easy to understand and use.
-Easy to manager-because it is in linear process.
-Phase are completed one at a time since the requirement changes are not allowed,the chances of finding bugs will be less.
-Initial investment is less since the testers are hired at later stage.
-Works well for small project where reuirement are very well understand.

Disadvantage:
==========
-Requirement changes are not allowed.
-If there is a defect in the reuirement that will be continue to next pahse.
-Poor model for long and ongoing project.
-Testing will start only after the coding phase
-Not a good model for complex and object oriented project.
