SPIRAL MODEL-:
==============
1-Spiral model overcome the drawback of waterfall model.
2-Spiral model is iterative model
3-We follow spiral model whenever there is dependency of modules.
4-In every cycle new software will be released to customer.
5-Software will be released in multiple version is called version control model.

Advantage:-
=========
-Testing of every cycle is done before going to next phase.
-Customer will get to use the software for every module.
-Requirement changes are allowed after the cycle before begin the next cycle.

Disadvantage:-
===========
-Requirement change are not allowed in between of the cycle.
-Spiral model looks like waterfall model.
-There is no testing in requirement and design phase.
